        <p style= "text-align: center;">THE HISTORY OF</p>
        <h1 style= "text-align: center;">COMPUTER SCIENCE</h1>

        <h2 style ="text-align: left;">Computing Before Computers</h2>
          <p>
              Computers today are seen as an electronic device that could be programmed to do many different tasks, 
              also known as universal stored-program computers. The first computer was built in the 1940s. But ther were 
              actually 'computers' before this.
        </p>
        <p>
            In some cases, the word ‘computer’ might actually meant a person who carries out repetitive calculations. 
            Lots of these ‘computers’ were women. One specialist company, the Scientific Computing Service, founded in 1937, 
            employed mathematically trained women using calculating machines to solve a wide range of military and scientific problems.

        <p>
            But prior to the existence of electronic computers, computations were carried out labortiously by hand, often helped with 
            mechanical calculating machines :

            At other times, on-off devices computed specific problems. But in comparison to nowaday’s computers, 
            these single-purpose machines were unable to be reprogrammed in order to handle different complications. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Then came Alan Turing.
        </p>

        <h2 style ="text-align: left;">Alan Turing's Universal Computer</h2>
        <p>
            In 1936 the famous mathematician Alan Turing wrote an influential mathematics paper, 'On Computable Numbers, with an 
            Application to the Entscheidungsproblem', which was seen as a theoretical foundation for computers. 
        </p>
        <p>
             In it he explained the concept of a single machine that could compute any problem, successfully combining all human or 
             problem-specific ‘computers’ into one general device.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some years later, these 'computers' started to be built in actual life and, by the mid-1950s, 
            were becoming more familiar to larger institutions, firms and university departments. Those early machines, 
            such as the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) could filled entire rooms.

        <p>
            A decade later, minicomputers were found, bringing the capability of computers into offices and laboratories. 
            By the 1980s, desktop computers as we recognize them today had started to become common.
        </p>
        <p>
            But in order to understand the power of computers, we need to look much further back before Alan Turing.
        </p>

        <h2 style ="text-align: left;">Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage</h2>
        <a href= "https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/ada-lovelace-the-first-tech-visionary">
        <img src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/590952556552fa0be682c157/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/ada-lovelace-290.jpeg" class ="floatRight" width="300" height="350" >
        </a>

        <p>
            As a noble woman in male-dominated sectors of science and mathematics in the 19th 
            century, Ada Lovelace was really uncommon.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ever since she was still young, Lovelace had been given scientific teaching and had been introduced by her mother, the educational 
            reform campaigner Annabella Milbanke, to some of the most noteworthy scientists and mathematicians of that era. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1839, Lovelace chose the renowned mathematician Augustus de Morgan as her tutor. She had also became close friends 
            with the mathematician and science writer Mary Somerville, who was also considered as her other mentor.
        </p>
        <p>
            5 years later, Lovelace published a report of Charles Babbage’s analytical engine in which she put out its chances as 
            a mechanical universal-purpose device.
        </p>
        <p>
            Babbage’s analytical engine was proven more than just a quick calculator—thanks to Ada Lovelace’s determining perception, 
            it offered the chance of an extensive computational power.
        </p>

        <figcaption style= "text-align: center;">Trial model of Babbage's analytical engine, 1834-1871</figcaption>
        </a>

        <h2 style ="text-align: left;">Lovelace's Conceptual Breakthrough</h2>
        <p>
            In her account, Lovelace elaborated that Babbage's device can do much more than handling numbers as quantities. 
            It could be a universal-purpose machine that represented numbers as abstract items, like symbols and musical 
            notes. She summarised by commenting about the extensive theoretical power of computational mathematics, as we might 
            now call it.
        </p>
        <p>
            "The engine can arrange and combine its numerical quantities exactly 
            as if they were letters or any other general symbols." -Ada Lovelace, on Babbage's analytical engine (1843)
        </p>
        <p>
            This conceptual leap found by Lovelace, that calculators obtain vast power if the numbers they manipulate are 
            symbols of other things, transformed computing and supported the technological evolution of modern computers.
